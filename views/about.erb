		<p>Hello. I'm a web developer and manager living and working in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire">Windsor</a> in the UK. This site is where I write notes and aggregate my content and favourites from services around the web. This is very much my personal site and content here does not necessarily represent the views of my company.</p>

		<p>Since January 2008 I've been Technical Director of <a href="http://www.globalpersonals.co.uk/">Global Personals</a>, a British online dating company that creates the software and runs the back-end for over 4000 dating sites through our <a href="http://www.whitelabeldating.com/">White Label Dating</a> product. I head up our 20-strong development team we call <a href="http://globaldev.co.uk/">globaldev</a>.</p>

		<p>Previously I've worked in agencies, corporates and startups, in and around London and New Zealand. You can read more about my professional background on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/barryfrost">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

		<h2>Keeps me occupied</h2>

		<p>My day job is increasingly spent in Gmail, catch-ups and meetings. Not so long ago I was a full-time developer and although I love my job, I miss creating things. So building and writing for this site (and other personal projects) is my way of keeping sharp.</p>

		<p>Currently interesting me are (in no particular order): Ruby, Heroku, Sinatra, git/GitHub, Python, Google App Engine, Node.js, Memcached, Redis.</p>

		<h2>Early adopter</h2>

		<p>I'm an early adopter - my account is the 4,677th on Twitter - and I habitually try out new services and technologies in the fear that I'll miss the boat. Apple hardware by preference.</p>

		<p>Find me on Twitter or email me at barry@barryfrost.com</p>
