	<h1>Switching from Chrome to Safari</h1>

<section id="body">
<p>About a year ago I started using Google Chrome on all my Macs. Previously, since its <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Firefox#Naming'>Firebird days on Windows</a>, I had been a Firefox stalwart, but Chrome promised to be faster and had a much more Mac-like user interface.</p>

<p>When I upgraded to OS X Lion I forced myself to try Safari 5, tempted by the promise of iCloud syncing of bookmarks to my iPad and iPhone. There were however three major features that I had grown to love in Chrome that Safari lacked and were stopping me from fully switching: the <a href='http://dev.chromium.org/user-experience/omnibox'>Omnibox</a>, tab shortcuts and extensions.</p>

<p>The following free tools bridge the gap and mean I can happily switch my default browser to Safari.</p>

<h2 id='the_omnibar'>The Omnibar</h2>

<p>I started by installing the first of <a href='https://github.com/rs'>Olivier Poitrey</a>&#8217;s two Safari plug-ins. <a href='https://github.com/rs/SafariOmnibar'>SafariOmnibar</a> mimics Chrome&#8217;s Omnibox, combining the search field and address bar into a single field.</p>

<p>With an Omnibar/box I don&#8217;t need to think about where I&#8217;m trying to go &#8211; I&#8217;m either taken to a URL or Google searches for me.</p>

<p>Packaged with the installer is <a href='http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php'>SIMBL</a> which allows you to patch applications like Safari. SafariOmnibar requires this.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id='keyboard_shortcuts_for_tabs'>Keyboard shortcuts for tabs</h2>

<p>Olivier&#8217;s second plug-in allows you to use the <code>cmd</code> and number keys to switch between tabs in a window, e.g. <code>cmd</code> + <code>1</code> to switch to the first tab, <code>cmd</code> + <code>2</code> to switch to the second tab, etc.</p>

<p>When browsing, my thumb and fingers hover over these keys and my muscle memory is so tied to these combinations that I&#8217;m much less efficient without them. By default Safari maps these keys to the bookmark bar links. I much prefer to switch tabs with them instead.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id='essential_extensions'>Essential extensions</h2>

<p>Finally, although extensions have been available in Safari since version 4, I hadn&#8217;t tried them before. A Flash-blocker is a must-have and the following one works well. Also, I prefer toolbar buttons for adding links to Instapaper or Delicious.</p>
