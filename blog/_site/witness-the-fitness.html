<p>I&#8217;m 32, unfit and getting a bit tubby. I drive to work, sit at a computer for most of the day and eat/drink what I like. This lifestyle has got me through my twenties intact, but it&#8217;s time to change. I&#8217;d like to lose a bit of the flab that I&#8217;ve gained and generally feel fitter and healthier.</p>

<p>But how? I&#8217;ve no interest in diets or fitness crazes. The only method I trust and believe in to lose weight is exercise and eating sensibly. There&#8217;s no secret formula, I&#8217;m going to have to put down the crisps and get off my lazy arse.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never had to give up smoking or needed to employ serious willpower, so there&#8217;s a danger of falling off the wagon and gorging myself on <a href='http://www.kettlefoods.co.uk/our-hand-cooked-chips/kettle-chips/'>Kettle Chips</a>. To help motivate myself and to keep track of progress I&#8217;m going to be using gadgets, data and stats. Not only do I hopefully get fitter, but I get to play with new toys. Win win.</p>

<p>So, firstly, exercise. I hate going to the gym. I&#8217;ve had spells of going a couple of times a week in the past but it never lasts. I end up spending more time driving, changing and showering then actually doing anything meaningful. The whole experience is a tedious time sink after a long day at work when I&#8217;d much rather be relaxing or at least spending the time productively.</p>

<p>I wanted a cardio-vascular exercise I could do from home. I hate running (too much impact on my knees) but I&#8217;ve always liked cycling. The exercise bikes at the gym were always my favourite of the machines so I reasoned I could buy one for my loft room. With a bike positioned in front of my computer, I&#8217;d be able to watch catch-up TV or listen to podcasts while getting fitter.</p>

<p>Researching a few models, I found the <a href='http://www.yorkfitness.com/products/170-exercise-cycles/1486-c202-cycle.aspx'>York C202 Cycle</a> on offer at <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000WZRTH0' title='The price may fluctuate of course'>Amazon for Â£180</a>. It&#8217;s got a clever little computer that takes your pulse, gives you speeds, distances, calories burned and has programmes for weight loss, cardio and interval training.</p>

<p>Every morning I get up a little earlier and do half an hour of the bike&#8217;s interval setting while (currently) watching <a href='http://www.channel4.com/programmes/todd-margaret'>The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret</a>. Sweating and puffing, I then jump in the shower and start my day. No extra showers or fuss, my heart&#8217;s pumping and I&#8217;ve even watched an episode of excellent comedy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m focusing on the cardio for now, but plan to add some weights later.</p>

<h2 id='eating_better'>Eating better</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve started with paying attention to high-calorie foods and omitting them. I&#8217;d previously ignored the information labels on packaging. I&#8217;m now learning a fair bit about how bad some foods are. For some reason I assumed peanut butter on celery was a good snack. And who knew how calorific orange juice is?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not calorie counting, I&#8217;m just eating less and choosing foods that are more healthy. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Better breakfasts</strong>: I&#8217;ve switched from sugary cereals to Shredded Wheat.</li>

<li><strong>Something sensible for lunch</strong>: sushi or a salad instead of a fatty sandwich and crisps.</li>

<li><strong>No more fizzy drinks at work</strong>. The water coolers are nearer my office anyway.</li>

<li><strong>No more midweek alcohol</strong>. I refuse to give up booze on a Friday or Saturday but I can omit the naughty couple of glasses of wine during the week.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid processed food</strong>. Simple way to do this is not to buy them!</li>

<li><strong>Reduce carbohydrates and eat more veg</strong>. This is a bit more tricky. What&#8217;s left?! I&#8217;ve started with cutting out crisps, chips and large quantities of pasta.</li>

<li><strong>Not eating when I&#8217;m hungry</strong>. I just drink some water.</li>
</ul>

<p>And a key for me: I plan on having one naughty/reward day a week. I&#8217;m not going to avoid a meal out or pizza with my girlfriend, I&#8217;ll just fit the good days around it.</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the fun part. Inspired by <a href='http://log.maniacalrage.net/post/5047120041/nerdy-adventures-in-weight-loss'>Garrett Murray&#8217;s Nerdy Adventures in Weight Loss</a>, I&#8217;ve bought myself a <a href='http://www.withings.com/en/bodyscale'>Withings WiFi Body Scale</a>. When you weigh yourself your data is automatically sent to Withings&#8217; servers. You can then review your progress online or via their iPhone app. It&#8217;s also compatible with <a href='http://tapbots.com/'>Tapbots</a>&#8217; excellent <a href='http://tapbots.com/software/weightbot/'>Weightbot</a> which provides glossy charts like the one here.</p>

<p>Part of my new routine when I wake up is to weigh myself and because the scales send the data wirelessly there&#8217;s no danger of me forgetting to record my weight. The Withings software can also Tweet your weight every day, but no one wants to see that.</p>

<p>Finding a way of tracking my progress satisfies both my geeky interest in stats, plus keeps me focused on the target. Any slip-ups will stick out and ruin my lovely downward chart.</p>

<h2 id='next'>Next</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m just beginning this project and by writing about my plans in this article I&#8217;m publicly committing myself to try. Witness the fitness! It&#8217;s not going to be easy, but I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll be worth it.</p>
