Long before anyone outside a handful of journalists had even touched an iPhone 5 I was told by colleagues and friends that it was a disappointment. Everyone had an opinion on the gadget I was patiently waiting for, what will inevitably become one of the biggest selling and most talked about computing devices of the year. 

## It wasn't always this way

For years I'd proudly supported the plucky underdog, the less popular option, eschewing the market leader for what I knew to be better. I relished supporting the little guy. I was a computing hipster. 

From the BBC Micro (fewer games than the ZX Spectrum but much more powerful and easier to program) to the Acorn Risc PC (staggering video and performance compared with PCs of its day) and finally to Macs, iBooks and MacBooks long before they were the de facto developer's machine -- the mainstream choice was never my choice. I chuckled at colleagues enduring Windows PCs while I embraced the elegance of Mac OS X.

Naturally, as a Mac fan, I wanted an iPhone. It synced with my Mac and MacBook and was a lightyear ahead of the candybar Nokia feature phone I'd been suffering. And so I bought one. So did my workmates. And eventually so did my friends. My sister too, and now my parents.

## The popular choice

And so at some point at the end of the last decade, Apple transformed from being merely Apple Computer to Apple, the world's most valuable company. You know the story. 

As a result Apple product launches became headline news, dominating tech websites and gobbling up column inches. Analysts scrambled to predict the bursting of Apple's bubble. Competitors couldn't help but copy. And those looking for the alternative to the market leader began to look elsewhere.

## Embracing the mainstream

Except me. I like Apple's opinionated design. I like that they refuse to acquiesce to the demands of mobile operators and compromise on their user experience. I don't want a cheap Android phone that's crippled by its manufacturer's customisations.

Apple still embodies the spirit of the underdog, doing things their way and flying in the face of convention. For me, buying an iPhone is supporting the plucky underdog, even if it has $100bn in the bank to help fight its corner.

And happily the worldwide smash iPhone 5 just happens to also be the best phone I can buy.
